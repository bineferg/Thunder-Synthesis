# Listening Test Evaluation

A subjective evaluation was conducted to understand the perceived realism of the thunder sound generated by this model. The listening test was conducted using [Go Listen](https://golisten.ucd.ie/) Using the Absolute Category Rating (ACR) testing framework, participants were prompted to input their ratings on a scale of 1 to 10 after listening to each sample individually. A rating of 10 indicates the listener percieved the sound to be real thunder.
